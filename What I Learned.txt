This is a simple example of an evolutionary algorithm
1) Evolutionary algorithms don't always converge to the optimal solution
2) The "bigger" the problem space, the better evolutionary algorithms become in relation to a brute force approach
3) Problems that work well with an evolutionary algorithm are those in which better solutions can be found incrementally (the fitter the individual, the fitter its offspring should be)
4) Individuals tend to become fitter every generation, but this is not a rule
5) A good fitness function needs to be gradual, not binary. For instance, "Was the goal reached?" is a bad fittness function. "How close did this individual get to the goal?" is better
